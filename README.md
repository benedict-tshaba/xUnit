# xUnit v0.0.1 - Tshaba Phomolo Benedict
## xUnit is a Beta Unit Testing 'Framework' for Progress ABL Code
### 'Framework' is in quotes because, this really doesn't come close to an actual Framework

# Usage:
- Simply clone this repository using 'git clone' or download the code.
- You will then need to put the directory where you saved the code in your PROPATH
- Then look under tests, for example unit tests and further usage instructions

> Note: <br/>
  The tests directory contains unit tests for xUnit itself. How cool is that? <br/> 
  A unit testing framework written test first! Now thats TDD at its extreme.

#### The inspiration for this project came from the wonderful book by Kent Beck : Test-Driven Development by Example
Get yourself a copy, its a really good book.
